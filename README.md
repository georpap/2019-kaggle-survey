An exploratory data analysis on the 2019 Kaggle User Survey.

### Comparison features
We are going to have a closer look at the two countries represented the most in the answers to the 2019 Kaggle User Survey:
India and the US.
Possible comparison features are:
* Age distribution
* Gender distribution
* Educational background
* Current role
* Salary
* Company size
* probably more specific workplace questions e.g. for machine learning yes/ne, etc.
* probably more specific activity/work questions e.g. tools, IDEs, languages, field, etc.
* Learning resources

### Goals of analysis
* getting an overview on the dataset and it's features
* cleaning the data to fit our comparison needs and features: comparison between the two most represented countries in the data: India and the US
* visualize comparison features in an appealing and intuitive way
* comparison and visualization of selected features between the years 2017/18/19 of the Kaggle User Survey
